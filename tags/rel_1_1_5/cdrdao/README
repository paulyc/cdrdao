Cdrdao - Write audio/data CD-Rs in disk-at-once mode
===============================================================================

This file contains some additional information. See the manual page for usage
of the tool.

Please use the write simulation mode (command 'simulate') when trying this
program the first time on your system. This will detect problems or
incompatibilities without wasting a CD-recordable. Note that you may have to
eject and reinsert the CD-R after a simulation run before a real write can
start.

Drivers
-------
The following driver IDs may be used with option '--driver'. It is possible
to specify option bits which modify the behavior of the driver. Global
and driver specific options are available. Options flags can be combined
by logical 'or' and appended to the '--driver' option, e.g.
'--driver plextor-scan:0x03'.

  Global Option Bits:
     read-toc/read-cd related:
        0x00010000: Use the generic method to read the TOC of a CD for commands
                    'read-toc' and 'read-cd'. If this flag is selected multi
                    session disks will not be handled properly but some drives
                    do not work with the currently implemented method for
                    reading the TOC of a specific session.

        0x00020000: If the byte order of the audio data retrieved with 
                    'read-cd' is wrong (i.e. not big endian samples) use
                    this option.

        0x00040000: Use this option if your drive cannot read audio data
                    from the first track's pre-gap. You will get read error
                    messages in this case which should vanish if this option
                    is used.

        0x00080000: Suppresses the automatic data type detection for the
                    raw TOC data and assumes that the drive sends BCD data.
                    Use this or the following option if cdrdao reports that
                    it cannot "determine if raw toc data is BCD or HEX".

        0x00100000: Suppresses the automatic data type detection for the
                    raw TOC data and assumes that the drive sends HEX data.
                    Use this or the previous option if cdrdao reports that
                    it cannot "determine if raw toc data is BCD or HEX".

        0x00200000: Do not try to read CD-TEXT data with command 'read-toc',
                    'read-cd' or 'copy'. Some drives lock up or send junk
                    data when asked for the CD-TEXT data. 

  Available Drivers:

  plextor
     Supports CD structure analysis (command 'read-toc') for Plextor CD-ROM
     readers. Pre-gaps and index marks are detected by performing a binary
     search over the Q sub-channel for each track. This method is fast and
     gives very exact results on Plextor drives. The driver uses generic
     SCSI commands (PLAY AUDIO and READ SUB-CHANNEL) so it may work on other
     models, too, but result and speed is directly correlated to the digital
     audio extraction capabilities.

     Option Bits:
        read-toc/read-cd related:
           0x00000001: Force usage of the paranoia method for audio extraction
                       instead of the special Plextor method that is used
                       with Plextor drives.

           0x00000002: Use the READ10 command to read audio data instead of
                       the vendor specific READ CDDA command.
                       Only used if the paranoia DAE method is selected.
  plextor-scan
     This is an alternate driver for CD structure analysis with Plextor
     drives. It scans the Q sub-channels of a track linearly like the 
     'generic-mmc' driver but is faster on Plextor drives.

     Option Bits:
        read-toc/read-cd related:
           0x00000001: Read 16 bytes PQ sub-channel instead of 96 byte
                       raw P-W sub-channel data. If 'read-toc' fails on
                       your drive try to select this options.
                       
           0x00000002: Only used if option '0x00000001' is selected. If set
                       the read PQ sub-channel data is expected to contain
                       BCD instead of HEX values. If the time count that
                       is displayed while running 'read-toc' jumps you will
                       have to toggle this option.

           0x00000004: Do not take ISRC code from the sub-channel data but use
                       the appropriate SCSI command for reading the ISRC 
                       code. This option is automatically selected if 16
                       byte PQ sub-channel data with HEX values is used.

  cdd2600
     This is a native driver for the Philips CDD2000/CDD2600 drive family.
     'read-toc' is implemented like in the 'plextor' driver but it is slow
     and not very exact due to poor digital audio extraction capabilities of
     these drives. Anyway, I don't recommend doing CD structure analysis with
     the CDD2x00 because it stresses the mechanism too much. 

  generic-mmc
     This is a driver for SCSI-3/mmc compatible CD-recorders that support
     session-at-once (cue sheet based) writing. Most of the recent drives
     should be compatible with this or with the 'generic-mmc-raw' driver
     described below. Data track support is also available.
     'read-toc' scans linearly the Q sub-channel of each track to retrieve
     the pre-gap length and index marks. This method is very accurate but
     takes the same time like digital audio extraction. It should also work
     with recent CD-ROM readers.

     Option Bits:
        read-toc/read-cd related:
           0x00000001: See 'plextor-scan'.
                       
           0x00000002: See 'plextor-scan'.

           0x00000004: See 'plextor-scan'.

           0x00000008: Try to retrieve the media catalog number by scanning
                       the sub-channels instead of using the appropriate
                       SCSI command. This might be an option if the CD-R/CD-ROM
                       drive does not extract the catalog number otherwise.

                       Note: A media catalog number need not be present on
                             on a CD.

           0x00000020: Use this option if the drive cannot read sub-channel
                       data along with audio data. A binary search method for
                       pre-gap and index mark extraction will be selected in
                       this case which has to play a sector before the
                       sub-channel data can be retrieved.
                       If 'read-toc'/'read-cd' works only with this option
                       you should consider to use '--fast-toc' since the
                       data retrieved with the binary search method is usually
                       not very reliable and not worth the additional time.
                       
        writing related:
           0x00000010: Enable CD-TEXT writing. This must be done explicitly
                       because there is no way to detect if a recorder supports
                       CD-TEXT writing. Trying to write CD-TEXT data with
                       recorders that do not support this feature usually
                       results in an error message at the beginning of the
                       recording process and in real write mode the medium
                       will be unusable.

           0x00000040: Suppresses the activation of the BURN Proof feature.
                       

  generic-mmc-raw
     This is an alternate driver for SCSI-3/mmc compatible CD-recorders.
     It uses the raw writing interface where the driver has to provide the
     PQ sub-channel data in addition to the audio data. This writing mode
     allows using part of the lead-out area for audio data since the drive's
     firmware has no chance to prevent this. Of course, you will get some
     error message at the end of writing when the CD-R capacity is exhausted.
     CD structure analysis is done like in the 'generic-mmc' driver. 

     Option Bits:
        See 'generic-mmc' but CD-TEXT writing is not supported.

  ricoh-mp6200
     Supports writing with the Ricoh MP6200S CD recorder.
     CD structure analysis is done like in the 'generic-mmc' driver.

  sony-cdu920
     Driver for the Sony CDU920 recorder. Audio and data tracks are supported.
     The Sony CDU948 recorder will work with this driver, too. Use option
     '--speed 0' to get the full writing speed.
     'read-toc' uses the Q sub-channel scanning method. 

  sony-cdu948
     Driver for the Sony CDU948 recorder. It extends the 'sony-cdu920' driver
     by CD-TEXT writing and multi session mode.

  taiyo-yuden
     This is an adapted 'cdd2600' driver for Taiyo-Yuden recorders.
     'read-toc' is done with 'plextor' method.

  teac-cdr55
     Driver for the Teac CD-R55 recorder. Audio and data tracks are supported.
      'read-toc' uses the Q sub-channel scanning method.

  toshiba
     Read only driver for Toshiba SCSI CD-ROM drives. The Q sub-channel
     scanning method is used to detect pre-gaps and index marks.

  yamaha-cdr10x
     Driver for the Yamaha CDR10X recorder series that supports audio and
     data tracks. 'read-toc' uses the Q sub-channel scanning method.


SCSI Device
-----------
Cdrdao uses Joerg Schilling's SCSI library. Thus the same SCSI device
addressing scheme applies as for 'cdrecord'. A SCSI device is addressed
by a bus/id/lun triple, e.g. '--device 0,2,0' for a device with SCSI ID 2 on 
SCSI bus 0. On some systems it is also possible (sometimes required) to
specify a device node directly, e.g. '--device /dev/sg0' can be used on
Linux systems instead of the bus/id/lun triple.

On Linux systems the generic SCSI device ('/dev/sg?') is required to access
the CD writer. Try 'cat /proc/devices' to check out if your kernel supports
the character device 'sg'.
If not insert the corresponding module ('insmod sg.o') or reconfigure and
compile the kernel. Cdrdao opens '/dev/cdrecorder' by default which should
be a link to the appropriate generic SCSI device.


Digital Audio Extraction
------------------------
The digital audio extraction is done with the help of Monty's paranoia
library except the 'plextor' driver which uses a special method for Plextor
drives. If you want to use the paranoia mode with the 'plextor' driver you
will have to use option '--driver plextor:0x1'.

The output file will always contain raw signed 16 bit audio samples
with MSB-LSB (big endian) byte order. If the byte order of the output
file is not MSB-LSB you will have to use the driver option '0x20000',
e.g. '--driver plextor:0x20000'. Please do not try to use '--swap' for
writing in this case because the byte order of the audio samples that are fed
to the paranoia library is wrong, too, which will cause malfunction of the
paranoia library routines.

Even if you specify a file name with a ".wav" extension the resulting
file will be a raw audio file without any header.

'read-cd' and 'copy' will read the first track's pre-gap, too. If your drive
cannot access these audio sectors which is usually indicated by read errors
you will have to use driver option 0x40000.

Currently, cdrdao does not support as many CD-ROM drives as cdparanoia. If
audio extraction works with cdparanoia but not with cdrdao please send me
a log of a 'cdparanoia -v' run and I will implement the required access
command.


CD-TEXT Writing
---------------
CD-TEXT data is read with 'read-toc' or 'read-cd' if your drive supports
it (e.g. Teac CD-532e, HP CD-Writer+ 8100) and will be stored in the toc-file.
It is also possible to create the CD-TEXT data manually by editing the
toc-file or by using the xcdrdao GUI.
If you want to create your own CD-TEXT data be sure to add the fields
'TITLE' and 'PERFORMER' to all tracks. 

IMPORTANT: The CD-TEXT writing feature must be explicitly enabled with the
driver option 0x10 (see section Drivers). If the driver is automatically
selected for your recorder model the driver options should be already set
if your recorder is known to write CD-TEXT data. Please report if the
driver database is not up to date or contains incorrect data.

The directory "testtocs" contains a template toc-file "cdtext.toc".

Notes:
  1) Writing with firmware revision 1.0i does not work.
  2) read-toc with plextor driver.
  3) Sold as Philips PCA36XCD CD-ROM.
  4) The generic-mmc driver will also work but the firmware seems to create wrong sub-channel data in some cases.
  5) See notes at the end of this file.
  6) This drive seems to ignore ISRC Codes and the Catalog Number.
  7) Firmware version 3.DS does not work well in DAO mode. Update to 3.GS!
  8) With firmware 1.0c and Adaptec 2940U2W the transmission must be set to asynchron according to Adaptec and Yamaha.
  9) Sanyo OEM 32x/12x/4x CD-RW drive.
  10) The firmware reports an empty vendor string so that the driver will not be selected automatically. Please use the --driver option.


Pre-compiled Binaries
---------------------
The pre-compiled binaries should work with 2.4.x kernels.
Other kernel versions may require recompilation because the API of the
generic SCSI device has changed.


Example for CD Copying
----------------------
The following command will copy the CD in the source drive specified with
option '--source-device' to the CD-R/CD-RW inserted in the destination drive
specified with option '--device'. Only a single session will be copied which
can be selected with option '--session' (default: 1st session). If you want
to keep the session open you will have to use option '--multi'.

        cdrdao copy --source-device 0,2,0 --device 0,5,0 --buffers 64


The option '--buffers' is used to adjust the ring buffer size. Each buffer
holds 1 second audio data. Dividing the specified number of buffers by the
writing speed gives the approx. time for which data input my be stalled,
e.g. 64 buffers and writing at 4x speed results in 16 seconds.

On the fly copying is selected with option '--on-the-fly'. No intermediate
data will be stored on the disk in this case.

If the source CD contains audio tracks and the source drive is slow you should
consider to reduce the audio extraction quality with option '--paranoia-mode 0'
or reduce the writing speed to 2x. For '--paranoia-mode 0' you will need a
perfect CD-ROM drive that can provide an accurate audio stream. 

The standard generic SCSI interface of Linux kernels < 2.2.6 cannot handle
multiple commands in parallel. Since the reading and the writing part of
cdrdao use the generic SCSI interface mutual blocking will occur. This
results in low fill rates of cdrdao's ring buffer and very likely
produces buffer under runs.

To avoid these problems you should apply Heiko Eissfeldt's sg-buffer
patch which can be downloaded from:
	ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/cdrecord/alpha/
It is available for 2.0.x and 2.1.x kernels. For 2.2.x kernels with
x < 6 the "SG-2.2.tar.gz" patch should be used. Kernel versions >= 2.2.6
do not need any patch.
      
I strongly recommend to perform some simulation runs before trying real
writing.


Example for composing an audio CD
---------------------------------
Assume three existing audio files 'audio1.wav', 'audio2.wav' and 'audio3.wav'
that go in three tracks. We do not want a pause between track 1 and 2 (no
pre-gap). The first 10 seconds of 'audio1.wav' should be used as pre-gap for
track 3. Here is the toc-file:


// Track 1
TRACK AUDIO
FILE "audio1.wav" 0  // take all audio data from 'audio1.wav', length is taken
                     // from file

// Track 2
TRACK AUDIO
FILE "audio2.wav" 0  // take all audio data from 'audio2.wav', length is taken
                     // from file, no pre-gap

// Track 3
TRACK AUDIO
FILE "audio1.wav" 0 0:10:0 // take first 10 seconds from 'audio1.wav'
START                      // everything before this line goes into the pre-gap
FILE "audio3.wav" 0  // take all audio data from 'audio3.wav', length is taken
                     // from file


Type 'cdrdao show-toc example.toc' to check for the correct syntax of the
toc-file. Note that even for the command 'show-toc' the audio files must exist
if the length of the audio files is not specified like in the example.

Type 'cdrdao read-test example.toc' to check if all audio files can be read
without error (optional).

Type 'cdrdao simulate example.toc' to perform a write simulation (optional).

Type 'cdrdao write example.toc' to create the audio CD.



Notes about some CD recorder models
-----------------------------------
MATSHITA/PANASONIC CW-7502

    This drive will only produce useful disks with the recent firmware
    revision X.17. The X depends on the drive hardware revision. 

    Thanks to Jeroen Steenblik <jeroens@esrac.ele.tue.nl> for adapting
    the generic-mmc driver to the CW-7502 recorder. He spend a lot of time
    and wasted many CD-Rs until it was obvious that the pre-X.14
    firmware does not completely comply with the SCSI-3/mmc standard. 

    Here are Jeroen's notes for upgrading the firmware:
    The update can be found at the Plasmon technical website,
    http://tech.plasmon.co.uk/, choose 'Download Files' and obtain the
    X.17 firmware for the CDR480. This includes all instructions.
    One thing I might add, when downloading the two files in the sequence
    described in their document, my drive refused the second file. I had
    to reboot after downloading the first file and only then I could download
    the second. Quite scary stuff. Swapping the download sequence should
    prevent this (so I've read). 


MEMOREX CR-622
    Submitted by Bryan E. Chafy <bchafy@ccs.neu.edu>:

    The drive as shipped comes with firmware that does not support DAO.
    The firmware lives on a PROM, it is not flashable.
    You need an EPROM burner, a 27c020 PLCC EPROM, and the
    D4.0 ROM image for the CRW-1622 (can download it from Memorex web site,
    the name of the image is d39e.dat).

    The ROM is socketed at the rear of the drive, you will see it when you
    remove the top cover.  Mine had a sticker on it with the numbers E07/885B.

    Note, this is for the CR-622 (and its sister the CDR-622 wearnes drive),
    NOT the CRW-1622.  The CRW-1622 drive is flash-upgradeable).

    IMHO, Wearnes/Memorex should be sending us new ROM's free of charge because
    the box clearly states the CR-622 supports DAO.

    The new firmware does not turn the CR-622 into a cd-rw capable drive.
    You can still only burn cd-r media.

    These drives sometimes have problems with writing at 4x speed. The
    resulting disk is hard read for some reason. Disks written at 1x or
    2x speed are fine. Yamaha's support is aware of this problem. It might
    be related to the actual firmware revision.
    I successfully wrote CD-Rs at 4x speed with a CDR400t and firmware
    revision 1.0k.

    The firmware restricts the possible disk types in multi session
    mode (DAO only) to one of the following:
    
     o Pure audio CD.
     o CD-EXTRA where the 1st session contains only audio tracks and the
       2nd session contains 1 data track.
	  
    Further restrictions:

     o The length of the 1st track's pre-gap is restricted to a certain
       amount.
     o Cue sheets with ISRC codes are rejected of the COPY flag is set.
       This might be fixed in future versions.


SONY CD-R CDU948
    The firmware restricts the possible disk types in DAO mode to one of
    the following:

     o Pure audio CD.
     o Mixed mode CD where the 1st track is a data track followed by at
       least 1 audio track.
     o CD-EXTRA where the 1st session contains only audio tracks and the
       2nd session contains 1 data track.
	  
    The length of the 1st track's pre-gap is restricted to a certain
    amount, too.

    If you want to create a pure data CD you will have to append a dummy
    audio track to the toc-file, e.g. with:

        TRACK AUDIO
	PREGAP 0:2:0
	SILENCE 0:4:0
