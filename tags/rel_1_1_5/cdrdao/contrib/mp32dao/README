This Perl script automates the process of making CDs from MP3 files.
It will scan the current directory for MP3 files, parse the ID3 tags (if present),
decode all MP3files to wav and produce a suitable TOC file (with cd-text 
info if possible).
Some of the code is taken from Joe Steward's mp32dao, using to pad one track with the next.
Decoding is done by a routine in mp3dec.c, interfaced using SWIG.
There is a package called mp3handler.pm used to decode mp3files to wav and print
some info.

In order to compile all the stuff you need:

-MP3::Info Perl module
-libmpeg3
-POSIX pthread library (usually found in libc on GNU systems)
-libsndfile
-libm (should be already present on your system)
