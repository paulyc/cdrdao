Hi,

cdrdao-1.1.3 is available from:

  http://www.ping.de/sites/daneb/download.html

This version contains some new features which are not tested as I used to do
it with previous releases. I'm just making this version public because I'll
move to another town next week and I don't know when I'll have access to the
Internet again. However, I'd like to encourage everyone to do at least some
simulation runs with the new 'copy' command. It should be possible to make
on the fly copies of arbitrary single session CDs now.

The xcdrdao GUI has reached a status that I would call usable. It's main
application is the composition of audio CDs and editing of audio CD images
created with 'read-cd'. 


Cdrdao changes:

 o Data track writing is available with all drivers, especially the
   'ricoh-mp6200' and 'generic-mmc-raw' can write data tracks now.

 o Added DAE capability based on Monty's paranoia library to all drivers.
   The 'plextor' driver will still use the special Plextor method for DAE
   with Plextor drives but it is possible to force using the paranoia mode
   with a driver option (see README). The paranoia mode can customized with
   option '--paranoia-mode #'. Please read section 'Digital Audio Extraction'
   of the README.

 o 'read-cd' creates now a complete image of a session. All tracks are written
   to a single image file (comparable to a .bin file). Pre-gaps and index marks
   of audio tracks are extracted while ripping the audio data so that a 
   'read-toc' step is obsolete now.
   It may choke on CDs written in TAO mode.

 o Experimental: Added a 'copy' command that performs all steps for copying a
   CD session with a single or two drives. By default a temporary image file
   is created in the current working directory. On the fly copying can be
   selected with option '--on-the-fly' which avoids the temporary image file.
   Copying of mixed mode CDs should be fine.
   I expect problems with source CDs written in TAO mode but I did not make
   any tests up to now.
   On the fly copying is not available for the Win32 platform, yet.
   Please read section 'Example for CD Copying' of the README.

 o 'read-cd' ignores sectors with L-EC errors now if option '--read-raw' is
   given. The 'cdd2600', 'ricoh-mp6200' and 'generic-mmc-raw' driver will
   recreate the erroneous sectors when recording.

 o Added full multi session support to the 'teac-cdr55' driver.

 o Added multiple language support for CD-TEXT. However, I have currently no
   access to a CD-TEXT capable consumer CD-player so I am not sure if CD-TEXT
   recording still works. Reading the written CD-TEXT data with a CD-ROM
   drive gives the expected results.

 o ATAPI CD-ROM drives that were only working with the 'plextor' driver
   should now be supported by the 'generic-mmc' driver with driver option 0x20
   (--driver generic-mmc:0x20). 

 o A CD-R medium is automatically ejected now before writing to reset the disk
   status after a simulation run which is necessary e.g. for the
   Philips CDD2x00 recorder family.


Xcdrdao changes:

 o Added dialogs for entering meta data like UPC/EAN, ISRC code and CD-TEXT.

 o It is now possible to insert and remove samples at any place without
   touching the audio files on the disk.

 o Added a dialog for configuration of all available CD-ROM/CD-R devices.

 o Recording can now be started from the GUI. Simultaneous recording with
   multiple CD-recorders is possible if the hardware is suitable for it.

 o Created a man page.
