Hi,

cdrdao-1.1.0 is available from:

  http://www.ping.de/sites/daneb/download.html


This version introduces data track support. Theoretically all track modes
are supported but I've verified only mode 1 and mode 2/form 1 tracks by
real writing. Data track support is not available for all drivers right now
(see below).

Changes:

 o Added data track support to 'generic-mmc' driver.

 o Added Henk-Jan Slotboom's driver for Taiyo-Yuden recorders.

 o Created driver for the Teac CD-R55S recorder. Data tracks should be
   supported, too, but it is not well tested.

 o Added Cam MacKinnon's driver for the Yamaha CDR10x drive family.
   Data track support is available, too, but also not well tested.

 o Added Leon Woestenberg's bitwise-exact digital audio extraction patch
   for Plextor drives (see README.PlexDAE).

 o 'read-toc' will analyze mixed mode CDs now, but it is currently not
   perfect. Please have a look at the README.

 o Fixed failed assertion problems with 'read-toc' that occured when
   the raw P-W sub-channel data passed the CRC check but was actually
   not consistent (happened quiet often with Teac CD-ROM CD-532S drives).
   
 o The SCSI interface can now use Joerg Schilling's SCSI library. Cdrdao is
   reported to work on Solaris 2.6 and FreeBSD using the SCSI library.
   Max Khon provided an independent SCSI interface implementation for FreeBSD
   which can be selected when configuring.

 o Added experimental CD-TEXT support to 'read-toc'.

 o Updated xcdrdao source to compile with Gtk-- 0.99.1.

Known Limitations:

 o 'read-toc' does not work for multi session CDs.

 o 'read-toc' does not work well for CDs written in TAO mode.
