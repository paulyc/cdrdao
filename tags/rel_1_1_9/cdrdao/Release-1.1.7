Hi,

cdrdao-1.1.7 is available from:

  http://sf.net/projects/cdrdao


This release is mainly triggered by the libedc_ecc license issue that
recently came up. The affected code has been replaced by a GPL compliant
implementation.

Currently a minor functionality is missing: Packed R-W sub-channel data
cannot be converted to raw R-W (incl. error correction and interleaving)
sub-channel data anymore as this was also a job of the libedc_ecc which
is not re-implemented, yet. The impact in practice should be very low.
If you want to copy a CD including the sub-channel data it is recommended
to use the RW_RAW mode anyway.


Cdrdao changes:

- Fixed crash in toc-file reader (only occurred for a certain type of
  syntactical error).

- Fixed compilation problems of "toc2mp3.cc" with pre gcc-3.x compilers.

- Updated driver table.


GCDMaster changes:

none
