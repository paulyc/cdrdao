Hi,

cdrdao-1.2.0 is available from:

  http://sf.net/projects/cdrdao


Cdrdao changes:

- SECURITY FIX: cdrdao now gives up its root privileges after setting
  up real-time scheduling, as well as before saving settings through
  the --save option. This fixes a potential local root exploit when
  cdrdao is installed with the +s chmod flag. Using --save also forces
  an early exit after the settings are saved.

- Added MP3 and Ogg Vorbis file support (through respectively the
  libmad and libvorbis libraries). cdrdao will decode the MP3 and Ogg
  files into temporary WAV files that will be deleted upon exit
  (unless the new option --keep is used). The directory used to store
  those temporary WAV files can be specified with the --tmpdir option
  (default is /tmp).
