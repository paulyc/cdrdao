Hi,

cdrdao-1.1.5 is available from:

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/cdrdao


Cdrdao changes:

o Fixed bug in CD-TEXT writing code that caused the problems with the
  unreliable read back of the written CD-TEXT data

o Fixed bug in generic-mmc-raw driver: the TOC type was not written correctly
  and some flags for data tracks were missing in the lead-in

o Fixed handling of toc type for multi session CDs: the toc-type of 
  a session that just contains audio tracks is always CD_DA, even in multi
  session mode

o Updated to libscg-0.5 from cdrtools-1.10a17

o BURN Proof support added by ITOH Yasufumi/Martin Buck

o Handle drives that do not support the explicit power calibration command

o Blanking of CD-RWs is now officially supported (command 'blank',
  option --blank-mode)

o Updated CD-R vendor table

o Settings are now first read from "/etc/cdrdao.conf" and
  "/etc/defaults/cdrdao" and then from "$HOME/.cdrdao"

o Added command 'msinfo' to output multi session information suitable for
  'mkisofs'

o Overburning is now prevented by default and must be explicitly requested
  with option '--overburn'. Fix for Debian bug #79585 
  (http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=79585&repeatmerged=yes).

o Fixed error in cdrdao's manual page (Debian bug #82816,
  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=82816&repeatmerged=yes)

o cdrdao's help screen was reworked by Michael Reinelt

o Added Giuseppe Corbelli's enhancements for the 'mp32dao' script


GCDMaster changes:

- Added missing 'toshiba' driver to the device configuration dialog
  (SourceForge bug 128633)

- Removed the CD-TEXT table entry dialog from the 'Project Info' dialog;
  it is now a non modal dialog on its own
