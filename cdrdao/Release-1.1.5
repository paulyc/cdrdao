Hi,

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/cdrdao


Cdrdao changes:

o Updated to libscg-0.4 from cdrtools-1.10

o BURN Proof support added by ITOH Yasufumi/Martin Buck

o Handle drives that do not support the explicit power calibration command

o Blanking of CD-RWs is now officially supported (command 'blank',
  option --blank-mode)

o Updated CD-R vendor table

o Settings are now first read from "/etc/cdrdao.conf" and
  "/etc/defaults/cdrdao" and then from "$HOME/.cdrdao"

o Added command 'msinfo' to output multi session information suitable for
  'mkisofs'

o Overburning is now prevented by default and must be explicitly requested
  with option '--overburn'. Fix for Debian bug #79585 
  (http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=79585&repeatmerged=yes).
