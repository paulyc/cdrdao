Installation:


The GnomeCDMaster GUI additionally requires the Gimp toolkit gtk+-1.2.8,
recent Gnome libraries (e.g. gnome-libs-1.4.1.6) and the C++ bindings
gtkmm-1.2.9 and gnomemm-1.2.2.  The packages are available from
www.gtk.org, www.gnome.org and www.sourceforge.net (project 'gtkmm').
You will need exactly the mentioned library version. With older or
newer versions the GnomeCDMaster sources usually fail to compile.


If you fetched the source tree directly from CVS, you will first have to
unpack "scsilib.tar.gz" and "pccts.tar.gz" in the same directory where
the tar files reside.

1. Type './configure'.
   Configure options for PCCTS (only required if you do not want to use
   the PCCTS version which is included in this cdrdao source distribution):
     --with-pcctsbin=dir     Specifies directory that contains the PCCTS 
                             executables (default: pccts/bin)

     --with-pcctsinc=dir     Specifies directory that contains the PCCTS
                             header and source files
                             (default: pccts/h)

   Configure options for SCSI interface:
     --without-scglib        Use a direct SCSI implementation instead of
                             Joerg Schilling's SCSI library. This makes only
                             sense if the SCSI library does not compile for
                             some reason. Direct SCSI implementations are
                             currently available for Linux and FreeBSD.

     The included SCSI library will be built if the following options
     are not given.
     
     --with-scglib-inc=dir   Use SCSI library include files from specified
                             directory instead from the SCSI library that
                             comes with the cdrdao package. This option will
                             only have an effect if '--with-scglib-lib' is
                             specified, too. If both options are given the
                             SCSI library will not be built.

     --with-scglib-lib=dir   Specifies the directory that contains the SCSI
                             library. This option will only have an effect if
                             '--with-scglib-inc' is specified, too. If both
                             options are given the SCSI library will not be
                             built.

   Misc configure options:
     --with-linux-qnx-sched  Enables Linux QNX real time scheduling.
                             This will only work if your kernel is compiled
                             with the QNX scheduler.

     --without-posix-threads Do not use posix threads for ring buffer even
                             if the system supports it.

2. Type 'make' to compile the package.

3. Type 'make install' as root to install the executable and the manual page
   under '/usr/local' or whatever was specified as the installation prefix.
