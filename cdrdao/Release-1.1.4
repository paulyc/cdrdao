Hi,

cdrdao-1.1.4 is available from:

  http://cdrdao.sourceforge.net/download.html


Cdrdao changes:

 o Created new 'toshiba' driver for 'read-toc'/'read-cd' with Toshiba
   CD-ROM drives.

 o Added full multi session support to the 'cdd2600' driver.

 o CD-TEXT is written without any copy protection flags now.

 o Added CDDB access to add title and artist data as CD-TEXT to an
   existing toc-file. The direct cddbp and the http encapsulated protocol
   is supported.

 o Fixed 'unit not ready' problems after writing with the 'generic-mmc'
   and 'generic-mmc-raw' driver.

 o Toc-files with tracks that are shorter than 4 seconds will be recorded
   if option '--force' is given.

 o Some of the command line options are now saved to a settings file
   "$HOME/.cdrdao" if option '--save' is given.

 o The driver database is now kept in an external file so it is possible
   to update the database between the cdrdao releases. Actual driver 
   database files will be available from

     http://cdrdao.sourceforge.net/drives.html

 o Fixed bug in CD-TEXT reading code: CD-TEXT fields with empty strings were
   only read for the first track.

 
Xcdrdao changes:
 
 o Xcdrdao is now a Gnome application and will be called "Gnome CD Master"
   (gcdmaster) in future.
   
 o Added table wise entry of CD-TEXT title/performer data.
