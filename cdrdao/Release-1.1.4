Hi,

cdrdao-1.1.4 is available from:

  http://cdrdao.sourceforge.net/download.html


Cdrdao changes:

 o Created new 'toshiba' driver for 'read-toc'/'read-cd' with Toshiba
   CD-ROM drives.

 o Added full multi session support to the 'cdd2600' driver.

 o CD-TEXT is written without any copy protection flags now.

 o Added CDDB access to add title and artist data as CD-TEXT to an
   existing toc-file. The direct cddbp and the http encapsulated protocol
   is supported.

 o Added support to better handle disks written in track-at-once mode with
   'read-cd' and 'read-toc' (see options --tao-source and --tao-source-adjust).

 o Fixed bug that prevented recording of pure data CDs with the recent HP
   and Sony recorder models in single session mode.
   For multi session mode the restrictions mentioned in the README are
   still valid.

 o Fixed 'unit not ready' problems after writing with the 'generic-mmc'
   and 'generic-mmc-raw' driver.

 o Toc-files with tracks that are shorter than 4 seconds will be recorded
   if option '--force' is given.

 o Some of the command line options are now saved to a settings file
   "$HOME/.cdrdao" if option '--save' is given.

 o The driver database is now kept in an external file so it is possible
   to update the database between the cdrdao releases. Actual driver 
   database files will be available from

     http://cdrdao.sourceforge.net/drives.html

 o Added new option '--keepimage' which keeps the created image file after
   the command 'copy' finishes.

 o Fixed bug in CD-TEXT reading code: CD-TEXT fields with empty strings were
   only read for the first track.

 o Driver 'generic-mmc': If the power calibration fails the recording process
   will be aborted now.

 o Driver 'generic-mmc-raw': Added explicit power calibration.


Xcdrdao changes:
 
 o Xcdrdao is now a Gnome application and will be called "Gnome CD Master"
   (gcdmaster) in future.
   
 o Added table wise entry of CD-TEXT title/performer data.

 o Added a dialog to extract a CD to the hard disk.

 o Added a dialog to do CD to CD copy, with "on the fly" as an option.

 o Speed and record buffer are now selectable in the GUI.

 o When reading/duplicating a CD you can set the paranoia mode.
