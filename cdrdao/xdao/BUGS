-	-	Infinite messages from cdrdao if you close xcdrdao while
		extracting: xcdrdao should not exit!! and if xcdrdao crashes
		cdrdao should get a SIGPIPE, continue recording and send
		messages to stdout if appropiate, but don't try to send
		messages to xcdrdao again.

-	-	In the Extract process xcdrdao is getting: 31 32 33 32 33 34 !!
		of trackProgress this makes the progressbar decrease and
		increase. It looks ugly :)

-	-	Using a big number with buffers when recording won't work!
		'new' throwing an exception? (try ... else ... ???)
