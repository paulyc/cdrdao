Hi,

cdrdao-1.1.8 is available from:

  http://sf.net/projects/cdrdao


Cdrdao changes:

- Improved performance of the new L-EC code by up to a factor 2 depending
  on the hardware.

- 'read-test' runs L-EC encoder over mode 1 or mode 2 form 1 sectors to
  allow performance testing in conjunction with option --speed.

- Fix for building on Mac OS X with gcc-3.1 (SF patch 611423).

- Support for ATAPI drives: device is now specified as [path:]<x,y,z>, such as
  '--device 0,0,0' or '--device ATAPI:0,1,0'. (Denis Leroy)

GCDMaster changes (Denis Leroy)

- gcdmaster was ported to Gnome2/Gtk+2 using the new C++ Gtk2 bindings
  (gtkmm2 and gnomeuimm2).

- ATAPI drives support: gcdmaster will also scan for ATAPI
  devices. Devices are now specified as a '[path:]x,y,z' string.

- The samples selection can now be cleared (i.e. unselected) by
  single-clicking the Audio view during Select mode (not in Zoom
  mode).

- You can now select multiple files from the file selector when
  appending or inserting tracks/files from the main Audio Project menu.

- Some features have been removed (temporarily): the multiple views
  feature, the 'zoom to selection' icon. Also the progress dialog is
  gone during import: progress is shown on the main status bar.

mp32dao changes:
- FLAC support. mp32dao now handles mp3/ogg/flac files. (Giuseppe Corbelli)

new:
- toc2cddb: translates a TOC file into a cddb file. (Giuseppe Corbelli)
