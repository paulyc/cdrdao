This is a snapshot of Joerg Schilling's SCSI library from cdrecord-1.8a27.

I added

    #ifdef __cplusplus
    extern "C" {
    #endif

    ...

    #ifdef __cplusplus
    }
    #endif

to "scg/scsitransp.h" and "include/standard.h" so that the library links
with C++ code.

The additional directory 'export' is used to hold some links to include
files and built libraries for easy access by the remaining cdrdao package.

It is also possible to use an installed SCSI library. See "INSTALL" in the
main directory for more information.
