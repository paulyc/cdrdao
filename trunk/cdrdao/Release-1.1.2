Hi,

cdrdao-1.1.2 is available from:

  http://www.ping.de/sites/daneb/download.html


Changes:

 o Added support for bin/cue images. A cue file can be used now wherever a
   toc-file is expected. The cue file must have exactly one FILE statement.
   The bin file name is constructed from the cue file name by replacing
   ".cue" with ".bin". Currently supported track modes: MODE1/2048, MODE1/2352,
   MODE2/2336, MODE2/2352. The 'cdd2600' driver uses the L-EC data 
   contained in the MODEX/2352 track images when recording. All other drivers
   will ignore and regenerate the L-EC data.

 o The 'generic-mmc' driver has full multi session support now. The start 
   address of the last and current session which must be used for the mkisofs
   option '-C x,y' can be retrieved with 'disk-info'.

 o The 'sony-cdu948' driver is included in the source package.

 o read-cd will create raw data track images (2352 byte sectors) if option
   '--read-raw' is given.
