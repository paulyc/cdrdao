Cdrdao changes:

 o  SECURITY FIX: cdrdao now gives up its root privileges after setting
    up real-time scheduling, as well as before saving settings through
    the --save option. This fixes a potential local root exploit when
    cdrdao is installed with the +s chmod flag. Using --save now also
    forces an early exit after the settings are saved.

 o  Added MP3 and Ogg Vorbis file support (through respectively the
    libmad and libvorbis libraries). cdrdao will decode the MP3 and
    Ogg files into temporary WAV files that will be deleted upon exit
    (unless the new option --keep is used). The directory used to
    store those temporary WAV files can be specified with the --tmpdir
    option (default is /tmp).

 o  Added --rspeed option to manually set the device reading speed. Be
    warned not all devices support this.

 o  Packaged scsilib library upgraded from cdrtools 2.01 (previously
    was from 2.01a31).

 o  Added --no-mode2-mixed option. Don't read a MODE2 disk as
    MODE2_FORM_MIXED, only read MODE2_FORM1 or MODE2_FORM2 (Matthieu
    Castet).

GCDMaster changes:

 o  MP3 and Ogg Vorbis support: you can drag and drop .mp3, .m3u and
    .ogg files from Nautilus into the sample display window.

 o  Added 'Select All' item in menu.

 o  Added 'Eject' button to progress dialog

 o  Bug fixes (sample selection weirdness, couldn't close window during
    play)
