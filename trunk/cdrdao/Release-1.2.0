Hi,

cdrdao-1.2.0 is available from:

  http://sf.net/projects/cdrdao


Cdrdao changes:

- SECURITY FIX: cdrdao now gives up its root privileges after setting
  up real-time scheduling, as well as before saving settings through
  the --save option. This fixes a potential local root exploit when
  cdrdao is installed with the +s chmod flag. Using --save now also
  forces an early exit after the settings are saved.

- Added MP3 and Ogg Vorbis file support (through respectively the
  libmad and libvorbis libraries). cdrdao will decode the MP3 and Ogg
  files into temporary WAV files that will be deleted upon exit
  (unless the new option --keep is used). The directory used to store
  those temporary WAV files can be specified with the --tmpdir option
  (default is /tmp).

- Added --rspeed option to manually set the device reading speed. Be
  warned not all devices support this.

- Packaged scsilib library upgraded from cdrtools 2.01 (previously was
  from 2.01a31).

- Added --no-mode2-mixed option. Don't read a MODE2 disk as
  MODE2_FORM_MIXED, only read MODE2_FORM1 or MODE2_FORM2 (Matthieu
  Castet).

GCDMaster changes:

- MP3 and Ogg Vorbis support: you can drag and drop .mp3, .m3u and
  .ogg files from Nautilus into the sample display window.

- Added 'Select All' item in menu.

- Added 'Eject' button to progress dialog

- Bug fixes (sample selection weirdness, couldn't close window during play)
