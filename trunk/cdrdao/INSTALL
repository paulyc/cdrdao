Installation:

You will need the parser generator PCCTS Version 1.33 to compile this
package. It is available from:

        http://www.polhode.com/pccts.html
or
	http://www.antlr.org/1.33/pccts.tar.gz

While compiling the PCCTS packages you may get errors on the target 'genmk'.
These errors can be safely ignored since cdrdao does not use 'genmk'. All
required tools are already built at that time.

Some parts of the standard PCCTS package won't compile with current gcc
versions. You can
 - compile with  make CXXFLAGS="-fpermissive -O2"
 - use the PCCTS bug fix release 1.33mr20a from 
       http://www.mcs.net/~tmoog/pccts.html
 - or fix the obvious errors in the PCCTS sources


If you fetched the source tree directly from CVS, you will have to unpack
"scsilib.tar.gz" in the directory where "scsilib.tar.gz" resides.


The GnomeCDMaster GUI needs the Gimp toolkit gtk+-1.2.8, recent Gnome libs
(e.g. gnome-libs-1.2.3) and the C++ bindings gtkmm-1.2.1 and gnomemm-1.1.10.
The packages are available from www.gtk.org, www.gnome.org and
www.sourceforge.net (project 'gtkmm'). You will need exactly the mentioned
library version. With older or newer versions the GnomeCDMaster sources 
usually fail to compile.


1. Type './configure'.
   Configure options for PCCTS:
     --with-pcctsbin=dir     Specifies directory that contains the PCCTS 
                             executables (default: /usr/local/bin)

     --with-pcctsinc=dir     Specifies directory that contains the PCCTS
                             header and source files
                             (default: /usr/local/include/pccts)

   Configure options for SCSI interface:
     --without-scglib        Use a direct SCSI implementation instead of
                             Joerg Schilling's SCSI library. This makes only
                             sense if the SCSI library does not compile for
                             some reason. Direct SCSI implementations are
                             currently available for Linux and FreeBSD.
                             The included SCSI library will be built if the
                             following options are not given.
     
     --with-scglib-inc=dir   Use SCSI library include files from specified
                             directory instead from the SCSI library that
                             comes with the cdrdao package. This option will
                             only have an effect if '--with-scglib-lib' is
                             specified, too. If both options are given the
                             SCSI library will not be built.

     --with-scglib-lib=dir   Specifies the directory that contains the SCSI
                             library. This option will only have an effect if
                             '--with-scglib-inc' is specified, too. If both
                             options are given the SCSI library will not be
                             built.

   Misc configure options:
     --with-linux-qnx-sched  Enables Linux QNX real time scheduling.
                             This will only work if your kernel is compiled
                             with the QNX scheduler.

     --without-posix-threads Do not use posix threads for ring buffer even
                             if the system supports it.

2. Type 'make' to compile the package.

3. Type 'make install' as root to install the binary and the manual page under
   '/usr/local' or whatever was specified as installation prefix.
