Hi,

Cdrdao changes:

- MMC-driver auto-detection. If no --driver option is specified,
  cdrdao will try to autodetect an MMC-compliant device and use the
  generic-mmc driver by default. (Denis Leroy)

- Added --eject option to the unlock command to eject the cd after
  unlocking. (Eric Benson)

- New 'discid' command to display CDDB information. (Eric Benson,
  Denis Leroy).

- Fixed scsilib compiling problems with Linux kernel 2.6 (Jim Gifford)
