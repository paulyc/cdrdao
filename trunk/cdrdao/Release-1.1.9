Hi,

cdrdao-1.1.9 is available from:

  http://sf.net/projects/cdrdao


Cdrdao changes:

- MMC-driver auto-detection. If no --driver option is specified,
  cdrdao will try to autodetect an MMC-compliant device and use the
  generic-mmc driver by default. (Denis Leroy)

- Added --eject option to the unlock command to eject the cd after
  unlocking. (Eric Benson)

- New 'discid' command to display CDDB information. (Eric Benson,
  Denis Leroy).

cue2toc changes:

- Version 0.2 released. Complete rewrite, should now handle most of all
  CUE files. (Matthias Czapla)
