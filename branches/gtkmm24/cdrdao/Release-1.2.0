Hi,

cdrdao-1.2.0 is available from:

  http://sf.net/projects/cdrdao


Cdrdao changes:

- Added MP3 and Ogg Vorbis file support (through respectively the
  libmad and libvorbis libraries). cdrdao will decode the MP3 and Ogg
  files into temporary WAV files that will be deleted upon exit
  (unless the new option --keep is used). The directory used to store
  those temporary WAV files can be specified with the --tmpdir option
  (default is /tmp).
