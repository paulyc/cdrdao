Hi,

cdrdao-1.1.6 is available from:

  http://sf.net/projects/cdrdao


Cdrdao changes:

- Fixed cue sheet setup for CD-TEXT writing. Some older drives did not like
  the cue sheet format as specified in the latest SCSI-3/mmc specification.

- Added sub-channel writing for the 'generic-mmc' and 'generic-mmc-raw' driver.
  Currently only the R-W sub-channels can be written. The track image files
  may contain packed or raw R-W sub-channel data. For packed sub-channel data
  the L-EC data will be calculated and interleaving will be performed
  if required by the recording hardware.

- Added sub-channel reading support for the generic-mmc(-raw) driver.
  Currently packed and raw R-W sub-channel reading is supported
  (option -read-subchan).

- Added automatic check for support sub-channel reading modes to the
  'generic-mmc(-raw)' driver. The driver options (0x1, 0x2 and 0x20) should
  be obsolete now, but are still available.

- The data track extraction with the generic-mmc(-raw) driver is more
  robust against read errors now. The --tao-source/--tao-source-adjust option
  should be obsolete now - but is still available.

- Added on-the-fly copying support for the Win32 version.

- Default blanking mode is now 'minimal' (SF feature request 425321)

- Updated paranoia libraries to version of cdparanoia-III-alpha9.8.

- Fixed waiting loop that was used to wait until the lead-out was written
  and until a blanking operation is finished. Some drives do not indicate
  this activities with a "not ready" status. Affected drivers: generic-mmc
  and generic-mmc-raw (blanking only).
 
- Fixed crash in cdrdao usage printing (SF bug 570156).

- Fixed cue sheet setup for ISRC codes for the HP8100 recorder model.

- Added/fixed SF patches 427753, 450058 and 534214.

- New mp32dao version from Giuseppe Corbelli with these new features:
  - Ogg support
  - MP3/Ogg decoding supported only with external programs
  - Code modularization and bugfixes
  - cdrecord's .inf file support for CD-TEXT data

- Cue parser accepts spaces and '\' characters in file name now.

- The PCCTS package is now a part of the cdrdao source code distribution
  which should avoid some compilation hassle.

- Updated scsilib version.

- Added patches for compilation under Unixware (incl. patches for scsilib).

- Created new utility 'toc2mp3' that converts an audio CD image to a set
  of mp3 files using the LAME encoder. The encoded mp3 files have no gap at
  the end so that they play in sequence without noise at the transition 
  points.


GCDMaster changes:

- Gcdmaster hotkeys are now back. (SourceForge bug 470864).

- Gcdmaster can now copy cds with just one drive, thanks to Das Poelzi for
  the patch. (SourceForge bug 566948).

- Added switch to enable the overburn mode to the recording options box.

- Added selection of the sub-channel reading mode the CD extraction options
  box.

- Fixed the 'Cancel' button staying disabled in the Recording/Reading progress
  window.
